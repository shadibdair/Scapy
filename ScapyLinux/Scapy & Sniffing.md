# Scapy
```
Scapy is a packet manipulation tool for computer networks,[3][4] written in Python by Philippe Biondi. 
It can forge or decode packets, send them on the wire, capture them, and match requests and replies.
It can also handle tasks like scanning, tracerouting, probing, unit tests, attacks, and network discovery.

Scapy provides a Python interface into libpcap, (WinPCap/Npcap on Windows), 
in a similar way to that in which Wireshark provides a view and capture GUI.
It can interface with a number of other programs to provide visualisation
including Wireshark for decoding packets, GnuPlot for providing graphs, graphviz or VPython for visualisation, etc.

Scapy supports Python version 3 since 2018 (scapy 2.4.0+).

Kamene is an independent fork of scapy. Initially, it was created with 
a purpose to add python3 support to scapy and was named scapy3k. Since 2018, it is renamed to kamene and continues independent development.

# What Is Packet Sniffing?
```
Packet sniffing, or packet analysis, is the process of capturing any data passed 
over the local network and looking for any information that may be useful.
Most of the time, we system administrators use packet sniffing to troubleshoot
network problems (like finding out why traffic is so slow in one part of the network) or
to detect intrusions or compromised workstations (like a workstation that is 
connected to a remote machine on port 6667 continuously when you don't use IRC clients),
and that is what this type of analysis originally was designed for. But, that didn't stop
people from finding more creative ways to use these tools. The focus quickly moved away 
from its original intentâ€”so much so that packet sniffers are considered security tools instead of network tools now.

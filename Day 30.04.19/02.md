### You can now edit the SSH daemon configuration file, for example, you can change the default port for SSH  connections. In the terminal prompt, run this command:

### sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config and the configuration file will open in the editor of your choice. In this case, we used nano.

### If you need to install nano, run this command: sudo apt-get install nano

### Please note that you need to restart SSH service every time you make any changes to the sshd_config file by running this command: sudo service ssh restart
